We worked together through several seasons. Their shapes and creative world and my fantastic and surprisingly style fit well with each other. The main aspects were practicality and wearability. It was a great opportunity, and I'm very grateful to the brand's designers (Dalma Dévényi, Kiss Tibor) that I had a chance to trying myself in an entirely new position, and I could use the impulses I have learned here later in brand design.",
